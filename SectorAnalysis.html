            <h2>S&P600 Sector Strength Comparison</h2>
            <h3>Data Analytics</h3>
            <p>This application uses Python to offer analyses of the S&P 600's financial landscape. A pandas function reads the data from the spreadsheet on the wikipedia page into a DataFrame:</p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-python">
url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_600_companies" 
html_content = read_html_from_website(url)
list_df = pd.read_html(html_content)
df = list_df[0]
</code>
            </pre>
            <p>With data from the Yahoo Finance library, it integrates balance sheets and income statements into the pandas DataFrame to allow for efficient manipulation.</p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-python">
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    ticker = row['Symbol']  # Extract ticker from the current row

    # Get financial data using yfinance
    ticker_obj = yf.Ticker(ticker)

    try:
        # Get desired financial information
        total_assets = ticker_obj.balance_sheet.T['Total Assets'].iloc[0]
</code>
            </pre>
            <p>Certain companies have incomplete balance sheet data, so they are dropped from the DataFrame</p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-python">
        if any(pd.isnull(value) for value in [
            total_assets,
            total_debt, 
            total_revenue, 
            net_income, 
            current_liabilities, 
            current_assets, 
            inventory
        ]):
            df = df[df['Symbol'] != ticker]  # Remove ticker from DataFrame
            continue  # Skip to the next iteration if data is incomplete
</code>
            </pre>
            <p>The data is then grouped with a sector-specific approach using the pandas .groupby function, and subsequently, dynamic visualizations generated by Matplotlib provide an intuitive interface for exploring financial metrics, empowering users to make informed investment decisions</p>
            <pre>
<code class="language-python">
sector_avg_debt_ratio = df.groupby('GICS Sector')["Debt Ratio"].mean().sort_values(ascending=True)
sector_avg_debt_ratio.plot(kind='bar', color=colors[:len(sector_avg_debt_ratio)])
</code>
            </pre>
            <h3>Visualization</h3>

        <div class="text">
            <p>This visualization breaks down the leverage profiles of the S&P 500 across GICS sectors. It reveals a clear difference: technology companies have a lower Debt Ratio (Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio) compared to those in Industrials and Finance. This observation aligns with established financial theory, which suggests that growth-oriented firms, common in the technology sector, prefer equity financing over debt because of its flexibility and lack of fixed interest repayments. This approach prioritizes long-term growth potential over immediate profitability, potentially explaining the observed lower debt levels. Interestingly, this mirrors the historical performance gap between major indices. The Nasdaq 100, heavily weighted towards technology, has significantly outperformed the more industrially-focused Dow Jones Industrial Average over the past decade, further supporting the connection between lower debt and growth potential. By highlighting this intricate relationship between sector, leverage, and performance, this visualization provides valuable insights for investors aiming to grasp the underlying dynamics influencing market behavior.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>This graph shows the average liquidity ratio for each sector in the S&P 600. The liquidity ratio is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations, such as its debts and accounts payable. It is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. There are a number of factors that can affect a company's liquidity ratio, including its industry, its business model, and its financial health. For example, companies in industries that are cyclical, such as energy, tend to have lower liquidity ratios than companies in industries that are more stable, such as consumer staples. Companies that have a lot of debt may also have lower liquidity ratios than companies that are less leveraged.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <p>This visualization breaks down the finances of the S&P 600, revealing something unexpected: the Real Estate sector actually has a higher average profit margin than the often-praised Tech sector. One reason for this is that Real Estate companies favor income over growth for more conservative investors, such as retired people. It's also important to note that the S&P 600, unlike the larger S&P 500, includes many young, rapidly growing Tech companies. These companies prioritize gaining market share and acquiring users over immediate profitability, which contributes to the difference in profit margins between the sectors. This shows why it's crucial to look at specific industries when analyzing profit margins. While the numbers may suggest that Tech is underperforming, a deeper dive into the industry dynamics tells a more intricate story.</p>

            <p>This chart highlights the top performers in asset turnover within the S&P 600. It shows how effectively companies turn their assets into revenue. Consumer Staples stands out as the leader, indicating their ability to generate sales without burdening themselves with too many assets. On the other hand, Utilities rank at the bottom, probably because of the heavy investment needed in their infrastructure. But, is this slower pace a weakness, or just a different strategic choice?</p>

                This graph displays the average quick ratio for different sectors within the S&P 600 index. The quick ratio measures a company's capability to fulfill its short-term financial obligations, like debts and accounts payable, using its most easily convertible assets. To calculate it, you divide a company's current assets minus its inventory by its current liabilities.
                
                Looking at the graph, you'll notice that the average quick ratio varies across sectors. Consumer staples show the highest average quick ratio, standing at 1.6, whereas the energy sector exhibits the lowest, at 0.6. This suggests that, on average, consumer staples companies are more adept at meeting short-term obligations with their most liquid assets compared to those in the energy sector.
                
                Several factors influence a company's quick ratio, including its industry, business model, and financial condition. For instance, companies dealing with inventory-heavy industries like retail tend to have lower quick ratios compared to those in less inventory-dependent sectors like technology. Additionally, heavily indebted companies typically have lower quick ratios than those with lower leverage.</p>

            <h2>Drawing Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                In the subsequent analysis, we aim to extract useful insights from the dataset we have created. We'll use previously calculated financial ratios to evaluate how well each company is doing overall. Employing a composite ratio methodology, wherein advantageous ratios occupy the numerator while disadvantageous ones find place in the denominator, we can formulate a novel metric for gauging companies' financial robustness.  This way, we can rank companies based on their financial health. Ultimately, we plan to identify and highlight ten stocks worth a closer look for potential investment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text"> 
            <p>The 10 stocks mentioned above are chosen because they represent strong financial performance within the index, based on the new ratio we created. These findings may have significance for different groups in the investment world, including hedge funds, individual investors, pension funds, and academics. These stocks make up a curated portfolio that not only shows resilience but also provides guidance for making informed investment decisions. They may offer valuable insights into smart investment strategies and ways to diversify a portfolio.</p>
