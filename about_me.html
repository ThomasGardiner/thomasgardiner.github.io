    <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
    <p>I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on data analytics. I have experience in various programming languages and frameworks, and I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding innovative solutions.</p>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I began my path at Drexel for Mechanical Engineering, but left to work at a Medical Manufacturing Company. Several years later, after gaining years of experience in manufacturing, sales, and later banking, I started a real estate company in 2023. Subsequently I left the workforce to study Data Analytics at the UC Berkeley online school, and graduated the certificate program with a 3.7GPA</p>
    <h3>Personal</h3>
    <p>Originally from Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, I rowed on the crew team and found time for the ski team in the winters. I enjoy summer visits to the Mid-Coast Maine region, reading, attending sporting events, and spending time with my loved ones.</p>
